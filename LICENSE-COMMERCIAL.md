# LiveCap Core Commercial License (Program Paused)

We previously explored offering LiveCap Core under a paid commercial license in
addition to AGPL-3.0. That effort is on hold, and no commercial licenses are
being issued at this time. The project currently ships exclusively under the
AGPL-3.0 terms described in `LICENSE`.

## Current Status

- **Availability**: Commercial licensing is paused indefinitely (last updated
  2025-11-13).
- **Contact**: Questions about permissible usage or interest in future
  licensing options should be directed to the LiveCap community via Discord:
  https://discord.gg/hdSV4hJR8Y

## Why keep this file?

- Downstream consumers may still encounter references to a commercial license
  in historical documentation.
- If the program resumes, this file will be updated with the applicable terms
  and contract flow.

For security disclosures or urgent issues, coordinate through the same Discord
channel so the maintainers can respond promptly.
